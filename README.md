+ Project summary: This project implements the algorithms described in the papers Learning Fair Representations (Zemel et al., 2013) and Fairness-aware Classifier with Prejudice Remover Regularizer (Kamishima et al., 2012) on the dataset used by ProPublica to analyze the COMPAS tool (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions). While both models had high accuracy in predicting two-year recidivism, Zemel's model was less biased against racially protected groups.

**Contribution statement**: 
+ Dingore, Saloni: Researched and assisted in the implementation of PR model.
+ Jiang, Chenyi: 
+ Qi, Yi Xuan: Implemented and tuned the final PR model used.
+ Raharjo, Safira: Researched the implementation of, organized codes and files of, and wrote the presentation for the LFR model.
+ Sanghavi, Srushti Divyesh: Researched the implementation of the PR model, tried and tested different inputs (X) for higher accuracy, organized codes & files of, and wrote the presentation for the PR model.
+ Zhu, Tianyi: Implemented and tuned the final LFR model used.
